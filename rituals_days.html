                    <strong>Durga puja is a ten-day event, of which the last five days involve certain rituals and
                        practices. The festival begins with Mahalaya, a day on which Hindus perform tarpaṇa by offering
                        water and food to their dead ancestors. The day also marks the advent of Durga from her
                        mythological
                        marital home in Kailash. The next significant day of the festival is the sixth day (Sashthi),
                        on which devotees welcomes the goddess and festive celebrations are inaugurated. On the seventh
                        day
                        (Saptami), eighth (Ashtami) and ninth (Navami) days, the goddess along with Lakshmi, Saraswati,
                        Ganesha, and Kartikeya are revered and these days mark the main days of worship with recitation
                        of
                        scriptures, puja, legends of Durga in Devi Mahatmya, social visits to elaborately decorated and
                        illuminated pandals (temporary structures meant for hosting the puja), among others.

                        which
                        Goddess Durga begins her journey from Kailash. On this day, people give water in the name of
                        their
                        ancestors who are dead and gone. This act of remembrance is a sacred beginning of the Durga Puja
                        festivities.
