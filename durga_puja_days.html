                                Puja.
                                On this day, the Ghatasthapana or the Kalashsthapana (literally meaning placing of the
                                pot
                                invoking the Goddess) takes place. The rest of the day is reserved for cultural
                                programmes
                                that mostly take place in the evening. Another highlight of the day is the "Agomoni"
                                programme. A set of songs in Bengali and Sanskrit are traditionally sung and performed
                                to
                                welcome the Goddess to her maternal home.</p>

                            <p>Day two of Durga Puja begins with the pushpanjali (offering of flowers to the Goddess)
                                and the 'Kola Bou snan' (bathing of the banana tree). 'Kola' meaning banana and 'bou'
                                meaning wife, the Kola Bou is believed to be the consort of Lord Ganesha. As such, a
                                banana tree is given a bath and draped in a white saree with a red border — symbolic of
                                a married Bengali woman. The Kola Bou is always placed next to Ganesha in the ornate
                                arrangement.
                                <br>
                                Next, aarti, or the veneration, is performed following which, mool bhog is offered to
                                Durga. Mool bhog, basically, is a special type of meal prepared exclusively for the
                                Goddess. Only after she consumes it can devotees eat.
                                <br>
                                It is to be noted that while many believe Durga Puja is all about
                                greasy-albeit-mouthwatering non-vegetarian food, it is actually the strictly-vegetarian
                                bhog that is the highlight of the festival.

                            <p>The most important day of the festival, the third day begins with pushpanjali and aarti.
                                On this day, people usually perform the Kumari Puja, wherein prepubescent girls are
                                worshipped for being a manifestation of the Goddess herself. The highlight of the day,
                                however, is the sandhi puja — which is done right when the Ashtami tithi ends and the
                                Navami tithi begins. It is believed that during this time, Devi Chamunda — an avatar of
                                Goddess Durga — appears to slay demons Chanda and Munda.</p>

                                While in the past people used to sacrifice animals on the day, the practice has largely
                                stopped on humanitarian grounds. Now, people offer pumpkins to the Goddess, keeping with
                                the tradition.</p>

                                highlight of the day is the sindoor khela, for which married women greet and smear some
                                vermillion on Goddess Durga, and on themselves,a bitter-sweet way of bidding the
                                Goddess adieu. Nowadays, this ritual has become more inclusive. Men, unmarried women and
                                even widows get to participate.</p>
